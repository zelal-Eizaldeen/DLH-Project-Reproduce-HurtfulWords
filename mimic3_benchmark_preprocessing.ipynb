Each row of listfile.csv has the following form: icu_stay, period_length, label(s). A row specifies a sample for which the input is the collection of ICU event of icu_stay that occurred in the first period_length hours of the stay and the target is/are label(s). In in-hospital mortality prediction task period_length is always 48 hours, so it is not listed in corresponding listfiles.\"\n",
