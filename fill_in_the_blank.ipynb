CMO status. Morphine gtt hung @ 5mg/hr for comfort, pressors d/c'd. Pt. expired @  SICU resident in to evaluate. Family with patient at time of death. Resp Care, Pt. remains intubated on A/C PHINUMBERPHI. No vent changes this shift. Remains hypotensive and acidotic despite Bicarb drip. Overbreathing vent, RR 30's. See carevue. Nursing Note 7p-7a See CarView for objective data and trends  NEURO:  Pt is unresponsive, pupils dilated at 8mm bilaterally and non-reactive to light. Pt has no response to painful stimuli.

Last ABG result from 0200 :12, PaCO2 22, PaO2 74, Base Excess - Pt started on D5W with 150meq NaBicarb for continous IVF. CV: At start of shift pt HR 90s-100s, in SR with bundle branch block and pt. was maintaining BP with MAP >60 on levophed gtt. At 0100 pt. converted to a junctional rythm and later had a 9 beat run of V-tach. Pt's BP dropping 80s/40s with MAP < Pt restarted on Neosynephrine gtt to maintain BP. With rhythm change, pt's CO decreased from 6 to 9, EF per PA cath   EKG done, doctor PHINAMEPHI and doctor PHINAMEPHI aware. Cardiology consulted, evaluated EKG. Pt also received multiple units of FFP, PRBC and one unit of PLTs in response to labwork and lowering BP  over the course of the shift. Pt also continously bleeding from nares, into mouth, and from the arterial and PA line insertion sites. Also, pt's right groin JP picked up on its output as well and dressing was changed by the MD PHINAMEPHI. Last Hct at 0200 3, Plts  Continue to follow Q 4 hour labs. GI/GU:  Pt not putting out any urine this shift. Pt's abdomen is soft upon palpation. BS absent on auscultation. OG tube in place and to LCWS but stopped draining. CXR confirmed placement of OG tube, pulled back slightly with still minimal output, not sumping. SOCIAL: Pt's daughter (HCP) in to visit and updated on pt's condition. Support provided to family. PLAN: Continue to follow labs Q 4 hours and monitor vitals closely. Titrate vasopressors as indicated for map >   Continue to treat low hct's and DIC picture. Monitor for S+S of bleeding.

PHINAMEPHI    placed. Pt brady down 30 s,  then asystole on bedside monitor; code    called; CPR started @     Post cardiac arrest MD spoke with both of the daughters of Mr.    PHINAMEPHI. Daughters present during cardiac arrest. MD discussed with    patients poor prognosis as PH 91 and hematocrit continued at 14    despite 8 units of PRBCs, likely active DIC and bleed. IR consulted,    felt unable to perform TIPS given instability. transplant surgery felt    not surgical candidate. Daughter who is health care proxy felt DNR    appropriate. Within one hour discussion of continuing poor response    despite blood products and difficulty maintaining on the vent with low    tidal volume. Hypotensive on three pressors. Family meeting held again    and wishes to make patient comfort measures. Within several minutes    patient became bradycardic and followed by asystole. Patient    pronounced  dead at 1:30 AM with family at bedside. Removed from    ventilator. No corneal reflex, no pulse, no heart sounds. No response    to stimulation. doctor PHINAMEPHI aware, hepatology fellow present and    hepatology attending discussed with family as well. Family felt at    peace with circumstances regarding bleed. Admitting notified. Family    declined autopsy.
